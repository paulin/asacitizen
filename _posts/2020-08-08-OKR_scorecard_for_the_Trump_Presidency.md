# OKR Scorecard for the Trump Presidency

## OKR Scorecards
One of the most important parts of Objectives and Key Results, OKRs, is to have a scorecard which you periodically review to see how you are doing. You can think of this as your grade card for a semester. There are a couple rules about the scorecard that are different though.

It is assumed that each objective is of equal importance, however you can weight the objectives if this is useful

The scorecard should be figured out before you begin the OKRs so that there is very little question as to how it will be determined later.

The goal isn’t to get 100%, it is to get 70%-80%. The reason is that people tend to always want 100% so they will make the objectives too easy at the beginning so that they don’t feel embarrassed or judged later.

An example of a scorecard could look like this.

In this case this team would have gotten an 84% for this OKR time period. Which is excellent. I think when they go through a review session what would be important is to capture what went wrong and right so that those stories stay with the team and become part of the collective learning for this product.

## What about politics?
With the elections right around the corner I started thinking about how President Donald Trump did for his presidency. As an exercise in illustrating how this could work I decided that I would try to put together a scorecard for his 4 years of work as our 45th president.

**What were the objectives for Donald Trump?**

Obviously this process isn’t being used so the first task is to reconstruct what the Objectives and Key Results would look like for the Trump Presidency. I decided to simply use [this set of campaign promises from 2016](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/22/here-are-76-of-donald-trumps-many-campaign-promises/) that I had found as a way to tease out what the Objectives and Key Results for his administration. I wanted to be fair about this and even though I don’t agree with the policies I tried to remain objective. If you want to just [jump to the analysis go here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDiEpu0LVs0A5NyIGx9g2Y9pil4BJhdlKwnF4yTu-Xk/edit?usp=sharing).

I used the following process to do this analysis.

**Step 1:** I categorized all of the promises into categories and ended up with the following; budget, education, environment, foreign affairs, crime, healthcare, immigration, infrastructure, legal, media, national security, opportunity, personal brand, and taxes.

**Step 2:** I also got rid of the “Personal Brand” category, which although that is interesting, it is really hard to measure and mostly is catering to folks that relate to President Trump’s attitude. I would say that all people have a personal brand, it makes you “feel” represented. Politicians seem to leverage this really well to create a brand or image that makes you feel like they “get you”. But this isn’t really helpful when it comes to setting goals and priorities. I want to know what they want to accomplish and how they are going to show this. Thus I didn’t bother to figure out how to measure the posturing.

**Step 3:** I went through each promise and did some research as to how he did. This took a fair amount of time and my sources could be better. Optimally you would tie this to an existing data source so that this becomes a dashboard that automatically updates. I also had to judge how he did which is admittedly subjective.  

**Step 4:** I transformed this into a new sheet to collect similar promises into the Key Results that the Objectives are derived from the promises.

**Step 5:** I wrote Objectives based on the Key Results that the promises implied.

**Step 6:** I averaged the Key Results together

**Step 7:** I assigned weights to the Objectives based on how much effort it looked like President Trump put into it. This was a chance to say what the real focus was and so this is very subjective. It really should be done at the beginning but I did my best to think like him and imagine where he felt his most important objectives are

**Step 8:** I applied the weights and totaled it together into a final score.

[You can see all of my work here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDiEpu0LVs0A5NyIGx9g2Y9pil4BJhdlKwnF4yTu-Xk/edit?usp=sharing) Also feel free to copy this google doc and play with all the numbers and weights on your own. Remember my goal isn’t to pass judgement but instead to show how this process would be superior to our existing unstructured system.

The results: 38%

**Disclaimer:** This scorecard is NOT intended to be a judgement of the 45th President
First, this is actually pretty hard to retrofit after everything that has happened. I’m also not a paid journalist and only have a limited amount of time to put toward a project like this. The purpose wasn’t to judge Trump as much as to show how this could work. To note, I do not agree with the president's tactics or policies. But I do feel that some of the company governance techniques like OKRs that we use in effective companies can be applied to the governance we use for real government.

On that note, I will share what I learned from this exercise.

##Why this is useful?
**Observation 1:** Objectives are a much easier way to understand a candidate's platform.
It is really hard to see what the vision is when it is a bunch of promises spread all over the media and from campaign speeches. This isn’t a criticism of just Donald Trump but of politics in general. It is a terribly confusing space where candidates seem to be very unclear about what they plan on accomplishing.

It seems like an effective president can only accomplish a few major objectives in a four year period and I think if they were to state clearly what those 3 accomplishments would be, would be refreshing to know how well aligned I am with them.

**Observation 2:** There are too many objectives
This analysis showed that there are way to many objectives. A group really should have just 2 - 4 Objectives. In fact the less objectives then that shows the more focus. This level of focus allows a leader to keep from diluting themselves across too many promises.

**Observation 3:** The key results should have been numeric not just a task list.
Typically you would create a dashboard for your team out of these objectives and then visit them regularly to make sure this is what everyone was focusing on. It helps if you have a numeric way of judging a Key Result. For example, we will increase the amount of wall by 10% every 3 months would be easier to see progress and allow for pivots.

Unfortunately, promises were either kept, or not kept. Much more of a boolean result where you either check the box or not. It makes your leadership more fragile since there are less ways to view incremental changes.

President Trump tends to talk in absolutes. It is probably because it is easier to remember that someone is going to “Build a great wall” but when it comes to Key Results, it is better to talk in terms of proportions to show progress. For example, if he would have wanted to increase the wall by 50% or improve the effectiveness of the wall by 30% this would have been more of an objective to rally around.

**Observation 4:** Priorities are being shown as weights
When there are many objectives, it helps to apply weight to them. What are the most important? How important is one objective over another? Applying weights to them communicates your intentions to your team.

## Why this isn’t useful
**Criticism 1:** Leadership is more than just a set of objectives.
A leader needs a clear vision so that when unexpected events occur they can use that same vision to make them more adaptable. The objectives I have stated here don’t account for the “Black Lives Matter Movement”, “Coronavirus”, or any other event that can come up in a 4 year period.

To take a step back I think the most iconic phrase Donald Trump stated was that he wanted to “Make America Great Again”. If that is the vision statement then my question would be “How would you measure that it was great again?”. These measurements become a guiding star that helps connect all the future objectives back to this vision.

For example, if you measured how great America was by the number of jobs in manufacturing you could easily then tie the Objectives back to moving this number.

**Criticism 2:** Objectives should have a smaller window
Objectives need to be adaptable over time. Four years is simply too long for an Objective. It has to be broken down to measure if it is being accomplished. This allows a leader to change out Objectives as more information is learned.

**Criticism 3:** This isn’t tied to real data
The way these objectives were judged was simply from me reading articles and finding sources of data to make these determinations. This really isn’t a fair way to do measurement since it is too subjective.

However it would be very possible to tie these key results to the massive amount of time series data that is generated in the United States.

## In Conclusion: What I’m proposing
Even though this took a bit of time to reverse engineer and retrofit the promises from 2016 to form a set of Objectives, it was about 20 hours of work. Any citizen could do this on their own even if a leader doesn’t do this on their own.

I propose that a dashboard is built that honors our leaders rhetoric. This dashboard should capture their Vision, Objective, and Key Results. These Key Results can be pulled from time series datasets and thus form an automated way to view how well the leader is doing.


Companies like Ally.io, Geckoboard, and Alluxo already do this for many customers using their dashboard. Why don’t we have a national dashboard to show how our leadership is doing?
