Hi, my name's Matt. I love to solve puzzles, especially difficult multi-faceted ones with many degrees of freedom. I love helping people excel in life and consider myself a pragmatic optimist. I love teaching people new skills and enjoy observing how they adapt those taught skills to their own personal ethos. I know how to incentivize my colleagues in a genuine, thoughtful way. I'm technologist who cares about my fellow humans and the earth, and I'm always looking for ways to lower the entry barriers of technology to make it more equitable for all.
